<!-- ![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=Undertone0809) -->

I focus on the design of **SDKs, infrastructure, and software**, adhering to the **Zen of Python** and the **philosophy of coding for humans**, aiming to build user-friendly experiences. 

On the other hand, I design and think with a futuristic perspective, looking at today from the standpoint of the next 20 years, **designing foundational infrastructure and the NEW WORLD for AGI along the trajectory of technological and human historical development.**
